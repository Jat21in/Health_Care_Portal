Hi, I am Jatin Mittal and Welcome to my Project "Health Care Portal Management System " :-)

Introduction:

Health Care Portal Management System Project in Java contains the doctor-patient table with all records. for example Doctor name, Timing, speciality, and availability.

About Health Care Portal Management System  Project:

First this project will show you the main menu. In the main menu, It will show you six tables. In this project, I have created six tables. 1st table name is "DOCTOR SECTION" , 2nd table name is "PATIENT SECTION" , 3rd table name is "MEDICINE SECTION" , 4th table name is "LABORATORY SECTION", 5th table name is "HOSPITAL FACILITY SECTION" and 6th table name is "STAFF SECTION".I have already saved some data in each table. For example, In this project when you will select "1" for doctor table then it will show you two options: "1" is "Add New Entry" and "2" is "Existing Doctors List" Now, If you will click on "1" then you can Add New Entry and if you will click on "2" then it will show you Existing Doctors List.

Thank you for watching my Hospital and Health Care Management System Project in Java :-)
